# TheRundownApiUsage
## Summary: 
1. uses maven to package and springboot for RestApi functionality
2. does not serve formated data( it does however print the formated data to the console)
3. the endpoint only serves the unformated json its up to the developer to move the object from the service to the controller which ever way thay see fit
## Problem:
1. TheRundown only returns 5 entries
## Setup
1. run maven install(install packages)
2. run mvn spring-boot:run
## Disclaimer
I realize the code could be cleaned up with namechanges/autowiring/ect. this is my first iteration. I'll come back to it when I'm bored one day.
